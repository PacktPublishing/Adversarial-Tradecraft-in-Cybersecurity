# Chapter 1 - Theory on Adversarial Operations and Principles of Computer Conflict
This chapter is all about theory and setting us up with guidance for future chapters

## Topics

This chapter covers several topics such as:

- Adversarial Theory
- CIAAAN
- Game Theory
- Principles of Computer Conflict
- Offense vs Defense
- Principle of Deception
- Principle of Physical Access
- Principle of Humanity
- Principle of Economy
- Principle of Planning
- Principle of Innovation
- Principle of Time

### CIAAAN

CIAAAN stands for **confidentiality**, **integrity**, **availability**, **authentication**, **autherization**, and **non-repudiation**


**Confidentiality** is the ability to keep communications secret. This means data can't be read by unauthorized parties.


**Integrity** is our ability to ensure information remains what we intend it to be. This means commands, logs, file,s or any information that we set remains true to its intended setting.


**Availability** means we can access the data or services in question. This means we can reach or list the service or data.


**Authentication** is the ability for a party to prove their identity to the system. This means users can verify they belong to the system.


**Authorization** is someone's privliges within a specific system. This means a user needs clearence to read or write to specific objects.


**Non-repudiation** is the ability to create logs or events to prove that events happened. This means we can generate a forensic reconstruction of events or see what happened historically. 


### Principles of Computer Conflict

The following are some principles which can add a huge advantage to a computer conflict.


#### <u>**Principle of Deception**</u>
This principle states that the use of deception, such as obfuscation or showing fake data, will help us get an advantage over an opponent in a computer conflict.


#### <u>**Principle of Physical Access**</u>
This principle states that physical control of a device grants a superior level of control, where the machine can be turned off, forensically analyzed, and reimaged.


#### <u>**Principle of Humanity**</u>
This principle states that computers are fundamentally tools for humans, thus will have regular human users, interfaces for humans, and human mistakes.


#### <u>**Principle of Economy**</u>
This principle states that both offensive and defensive teams have limited budgets and can only invest in so many strategies for their operations.


#### <u>**Principle of Planning**</u>
This principle states that writing down or automating plans will provide an advantage when dealing with the complexity in a high stress situation.


#### <u>**Principle of Innovation**</u>
This principle states that the level of complexity makes it easier to innovate as well as providing noticeable advantages in a competition environment.


#### <u>**Principle of Time**</u>
This principle shows how time relates to computer conflicts, such as automation and fast moving exploit chains to stagnant infrastructure becoming easier to exploit over time.
