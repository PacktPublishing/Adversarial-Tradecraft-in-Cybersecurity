# Chapter 1 - Preparing for Battle
This chapter is all about theory and setting us up with guidance for future chapters

## Topics

This chapter covers several topics such as:

- Adversarial Theory
- CIAAAN
- Game Theory
- Principles of Computer Conflict
- Offense vs Defense
- Principle of Deception
- Principle of Physical Access
- Principle of Humanity
- Principle of Economy
- Principle of Planning
- Principle of Innovation
- Principle of Time

### CIAAAN

CIAAAN stands for *confidentiality*, *integrity*, *availability*, *authentication*, *autherization*, and *non-repudiation*


#### Confidentiality

Confidentiality is the ability to keep communications secret. This means data can't be read by unauthorized parties.


#### Integrity

Integrity is our ability to ensure information remains what we intend it to be. This means commands, logs, file,s or any information that we set remains true to its intended setting.

#### Availability

Availability means we can access the data or services in question. This means we can reach or list the service or data.


#### Authentication

Authentication is the ability for a party to prove their identity to the system. This means users can verify they belong to the system.


#### Autherization

Autherization is someone's privliges within a specific system. This means a user needs clearence to read or write to specific objects.


#### Non-repudiation

Non-repudiation is the ability to create logs or events to prove that events happened. This means we can generate a forensic reconstruction of events or see what happened historically. 


### Principles of Computer Conflict

The following are some principles which can add a huge advantage to a computer conflict.


#### Principle of Deception


#### Principle of Physical Access


#### Principle of Humanity


#### Principle of Economy


#### Principle of Planning


#### Principle of Innovation


#### Principle of Time
